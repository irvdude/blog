# blog

## These entries contain blog posts that (almost) all involve my journey in programming. Whether you met me IRL at Meetups, discovered me on social media (Youtube, X fka Twitter) or chatted with me over Discord, however you found my Github profile, I welcome you. Enjoy and have a great read.

### If we met prior to you discovering this blog, then you likely know how to reach out to me. If for some reason you dont, reach out to me via links embedding in my Github profile, or over Discord @swrvr.
